      "  'value': AIMessageChunk(content=\"Model regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise and random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns.\\n\\nThe purpose of regularization is to add a penalty term to the loss function that the model is trying to minimize. This term discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data too closely, and instead encourages it to find a more general solution that will perform well on new data.\\n\\nThere are several types of regularization techniques, including:\\n\\n1. L1 Regularization (Lasso): This adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which in turn reduces overfitting.\\n2. L2 Regularization (Ridge): This adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This also encourages the model to have smaller weights and reduce overfitting.\\n3. Dropout Regularization: This involves randomly setting a fraction of the model's neurons to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of different sub-networks. This helps to prevent any single neuron from dominating the model's behavior.\\n4. Early Stopping: This involves monitoring the validation loss during training and stopping the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This helps to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model has a chance to fit the noise in the data too closely.\\n5. Batch Normalization: This involves normalizing the inputs to each neuron to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps to reduce overfitting by reducing the effect of internal covariate shift.\\n6. Weight Decay: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function for each parameter in the model, which encourages the model to learn more sparse representations.\\n7. Label Smoothing: This involves smoothing the labels of the training data, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the effect of label imbalance.\\n8. Gradient Clipping: This involves clipping the gradients of the model during training, which helps to prevent exploding gradients and reduce overfitting.\\n9. Masking: This involves masking some of the input features or samples during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the effect of irrelevant features.\\n10. Adversarial Training: This involves training the model on adversarial examples, which helps to improve the model's robustness against attacks and reduce overfitting.\\n\\nThese are some of the common regularization techniques used in deep learning.

       "'There are several theories about the relationship between unemployment and inflation, which are debated among economists. Here are some of the most prominent ones:\\n\\n1. **Phillips Curve**: This classic theory (named after Alban William Phillips) suggests that there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation. As unemployment falls, inflation rises, and vice versa. The curve was thought to be upward-sloping, meaning that low unemployment could only be achieved at the cost of higher inflation.\\n2. **NAIRU** (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment): This theory proposes that there is a natural rate of unemployment, below which inflation will accelerate and above which it will decelerate. The NAIRU is thought to be around 5-6% in many countries, meaning that if unemployment falls too low, inflation will rise.\\n3. **Monetarist Theory**: This theory, popularized by Milton Friedman, suggests that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is not as strong as previously thought. Monetarists argue that monetary policy (i.e., changes in the money supply) is more important than aggregate demand (i.e., spending and production) in determining inflation.\\n4. **New Keynesian Theory**: This theory posits that there are costs associated with adjusting prices, which can lead to a short-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation. However, these costs will eventually decline as firms and workers adjust to changing market conditions.\\n5. **Supply-Side Theory**: This theory emphasizes the role of labor market rigidities (e.g., minimum wages, collective bargaining) and other structural factors in shaping the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Supply-siders argue that policies aimed at reducing these rigidities can lead to lower unemployment and inflation.\\n6. **Equilibrium Theory**: This approach suggests that there is no long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation. Instead, changes in one variable will eventually lead to changes in the other, but both will return to their equilibrium levels over time.\\n7. **Animal Spirits** (John Maynard Keynes): This theory, while not directly addressing the relationship between unemployment and inflation, suggests that aggregate demand can be influenced by psychological factors such as consumer confidence and business expectations. These \"animal spirits\" can lead to changes in spending and production that affect both unemployment and inflation.\\n\\nThese theories are not mutually exclusive, and many economists believe that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is complex and depends on various economic conditions.'"

voice:\\n\\n\"Hugson\\'s Siding!\"\\n\\nAt once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the\\ncar, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage\\ncovered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked\\nunder her arm.\\n\\nThe conductor helped her off the car and then the\\nengineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and\\nmoved slowly away up the track.\\n\\nThe reason he was so late was because\\nall through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and\\ntrembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the\\nrails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers.\\n\\nSo he\\nmoved the cars slowly and with caution.\\n\\nThe little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared\\naround a curve; then she turned to see where she was.\\n\\nThe shed at Hugson\\'s Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and\\ndid not look very inviting.\\n\\nAs she peered through the soft gray light\\nnot a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person\\nin sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy\\nstanding near a group of trees a short distance away.\\n\\nShe walked toward\\nit and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its\\nhead hanging down almost to the ground.\\n\\nIt was a big horse, tall and\\nbony, with long legs and large knees and feet.\\n\\nShe could count his ribs\\neasily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was\\nlong and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit.\\n\\nHis\\ntail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many\\nplaces and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire.\\n\\nThe\\nbuggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.\\n\\nGetting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a\\nboy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.\\n\\nShe set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol.', metadata={'document': 1}), Document(page_content='Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw

briskly.\\n\\n\"Hello!\"\\n\\nhe said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking\\ngray eyes.\\n\\n\"Have you come to take me to Hugson\\'s Ranch?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" he answered.\\n\\n\"Train in?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t be here if it wasn\\'t,\" she said.\\n\\nHe laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.\\n\\nJumping out of\\nthe buggy he put Dorothy\\'s suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on\\nthe floor in front.\\n\\n\"Canary-birds?\"\\n\\nhe asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, no; it\\'s just Eureka, my kitten.\\n\\nI thought that was the best way to\\ncarry her.\"\\n\\nThe boy nodded.\\n\\n\"Eureka\\'s a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.\\n\\n\"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained.\\n\\n\"Uncle Henry\\nsays \\'Eureka\\' means \\'I have found it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"All right; hop in.\"\\n\\nShe climbed into the buggy and he followed her.\\n\\nThen the boy picked up\\nthe reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"\\n\\nThe horse did not stir.\\n\\nDorothy thought he just wiggled one of his\\ndrooping ears, but that was all.\\n\\n\"Gid-dap!\"\\n\\ncalled the boy, again.\\n\\nThe horse stood still.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"\\n\\nThe boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.\\n\\n\"Guess I\\'m half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse.\\n\\n\"But Jim knows\\nhis business all right--don\\'t you, Jim?\"\\n\\npatting the long nose of the\\nanimal.\\n\\nThen he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at\\nonce backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot\\ndown the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.\\n\\n\"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve waited at\\nthat station for five hours.\"\\n\\n\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you feel the ground\\nshake?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but we\\'re used to

face.\\n\\n\"It\\nalmost got us that time, Dorothy.\"\\n\\nThe horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.\\n\\nZeb shook the\\nreins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn.\\n\\nThen the

minutes.\\n\\nThere was a\\nbreath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would\\nshake violently.\\n\\nJim\\'s ears were standing erect upon his head and every\\nmuscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home.\\n\\nHe was not\\ngoing very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at\\ntimes he would tremble like a leaf.\\n\\nThe sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as\\nit swept over the valley.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into\\nanother great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.\\n\\nWith a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawing\\nthe buggy and its occupants after him.\\n\\nDorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same.\\n\\nThe\\nsudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.\\n\\nBlackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they\\nwaited for the fall to end

GLASS CITY\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so\\nfast.\\n\\nThe top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an\\numbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated\\ndownward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.\\n\\nThe worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great\\ncrack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to\\novertake them at any moment.\\n\\nCrash after crash echoed far above their\\nheads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and\\nchunks of clay rattled around them on every side.\\n\\nThese they could not\\nsee, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed\\nalmost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his\\nboney body.\\n\\nThey did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything\\nwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the\\nhorse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, so\\nthat the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was\\ninjured.\\n\\nHow long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,\\nshe was so greatly bewildered.\\n\\nBut bye and bye, as she stared ahead into\\nthe black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form of\\nthe horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs\\nsprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space.\\n\\nAlso, turning\\nher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until\\nnow remained as still and silent as she herself.\\n\\nDorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.', metadata={'document': 1}), Document(page_content='Also, turning\\nher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until\\nnow remained as still and silent as she herself.\\n\\nDorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.\\n\\nShe began to realize\\nthat death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely\\nstarted upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and\\nunusual as were those she had before encountered.\\n\\nWith this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over\\nthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.\\n\\nFar below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.\\n\\nThe central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.\\n\\nAround it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five\\nbrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one\\nblue and one orange.\\n\\nThis splendid group of colored suns sent rays\\ndarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy and\\nZeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays\\nbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more\\nand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly\\nilluminated.\\n\\nDorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim\\'s big ears\\nturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should\\nbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of\\na zebra.\\n\\nThen she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was\\npink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it funny?\"\\n\\nshe said.\\n\\nThe boy was startled and his eyes were big.\\n\\nDorothy had a green streak\\nthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came\\ntogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.\\n\\n\"I--I don\\'t s-s-see any-thing funny--\\'bout it!\"\\n\\nhe stammered.\\n\\n[Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL

BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]\\n\\nJust then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the\\nhorse tipping also.\\n\\nBut they continued to fall, all together, and the\\nboy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they\\nwere before.\\n\\nThen they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll\\nslowly over until they were right side up again.\\n\\nDuring this time Jim\\nstruggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding\\nhimself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of\\nvoice:\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s better!\"\\n\\nDorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.\\n\\n\"Can your horse talk?\"\\n\\nshe asked.\\n\\n\"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.\\n\\n\"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had\\noverheard them, \"and I can\\'t explain why I happened to speak then.\\n\\nThis\\nis a nice scrape you\\'ve got me into, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,\\ncheerfully.\\n\\n\"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry it\\nhappened.\"\\n\\nZeb gave a shiver.\\n\\nAll this was so terrible and unreal that he could not\\nunderstand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.\\n\\nSwiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close\\nbeside them.\\n\\nThe light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,\\nand they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.\\n\\nThere was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had\\npassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing\\nrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep\\nsigh.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t keep falling forever, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"We are somewhere in the middle of the\\nearth, and the chances are we\\'ll reach the other side of it before long.\\n\\nBut it\\'s a big hollow, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Awful big!\"', metadata={'document': 1}),

looked\\ndown.\\n\\nYes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either.\\n\\nBut they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it could no\\nlonger be called a fall--and the children had ample time to take heart\\nand look about them.\\n\\nThey saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very\\nlike those upon the earth\\'s surface; but all the scene was splendidly\\ncolored by the variegated lights from the six suns.\\n\\nHere and there were\\ngroups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled\\nso brightly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice.\\n\\n\"We are\\nfalling so slowly that we can\\'t be dashed to pieces when we land, and\\nthis country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll never get home again, though!\"\\n\\ndeclared Zeb, with a groan.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not so sure of that,\" replied the girl.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t let us worry\\nover such things, Zeb; we can\\'t help ourselves just now, you know, and\\nI\\'ve always been told it\\'s foolish to borrow trouble.\"\\n\\nThe boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon\\nboth were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out\\nbelow them.\\n\\nThey seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big\\ncity which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointed\\nspires.\\n\\nThese spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled\\nupon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.\\n\\nJim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight\\nup with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense.\\n\\nBut\\nno; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stop\\nat

which rolled out upon the roof so that the\\nbottom came off.\\n\\nAt once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, sat\\ndown upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"There\\'s Eureka.\"\\n\\n\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.\\n\\n\"Eureka isn\\'t pink; she\\'s white.\\n\\nIt\\'s this queer light that gives

and transparent\\nthat one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.\\n\\nDorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used\\nfor rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queer\\nforms huddled into the corners of these rooms.\\n\\nThe roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of\\nglass were lying scattered in every direction.\\n\\nA near by steeple had\\nbeen broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it.\\n\\nOther\\nbuildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;\\nbut they

picked before they can become good citizens.\"\\n\\n\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\"\\n\\nasked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"If

grinning mouths.\\n\\nOthers had\\nflat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of an\\nelephant.\\n\\nThere were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; but\\nall were equally disagreeable in appearance.\\n\\nThe tops of their heads had\\nno hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some having\\na row of points or balls around the top, other designs resembling\\nflowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked like\\nwaffles cut criss-cross on their heads.\\n\\nThey all wore short wooden wings\\nwhich were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges\\nwith wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly and\\nnoiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them.', metadata={'document':

enough oil in the lanterns\\nto give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they were\\nable to jump over them.\\n\\nSometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose\\nrock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy.\\n\\nAt such times Dorothy,\\nZeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over the\\nroughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going.\\n\\nBut the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, on\\nturning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave\\narching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor.\\n\\nThe cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the\\nground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always\\nside by side.\\n\\nThese were motionless at first, but soon began to flicker\\nmore brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down.\\n\\n\"What sort of a place is this?\"\\n\\nasked the boy, trying to see more\\nclearly through the gloom.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine, I\\'m sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about.\\n\\n\"Woogh!\"\\n\\nsnarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood

call themselves dragons, and that\\nseemed like a good while to wait to grow up.\\n\\n\"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this\\nplace before the mother dragon comes

sat the queerly assorted Jury--animals, animated\\ndummies and people--all gravely prepared to listen to what was said.\\n\\nThe\\nkitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne, where she\\nsat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds around\\nher, with seeming unconcern.\\n\\nAnd now, at a signal from Ozma, the Woggle-Bug arose and addressed the\\njury.\\n\\nHis

Woggle-Bug.\\n\\n\"When I get my\\nthoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upset\\nthem or throw them into confusion.\"\\n\\n\"If your thoughts were any good they wouldn\\'t

the Tin Woodman arose and said:\\n\\n\"Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma, I pray you not to judge this\\nfeline prisoner unfeelingly.\\n\\nI do not think the innocent kitten can be\\nguilty, and

the Jury, the members whispered to each other\\nfor a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger their\\nspokesman.\\n\\nThe huge beast slowly arose and said:\\n\\n\"Kittens have no

that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing\\non the floor.\\n\\nThe vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the top\\nlike a bowl.\\n\\nAt first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I\\nthought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through and\\nfell down into the deep bottom part--and I suppose he\\'s there yet.\"\\n\\nAll were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officer\\nto her room to fetch the vase.\\n\\nWhen he returned the Princess looked down\\nthe narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, just\\nas Eureka had said she would.\\n\\nThere was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, so\\nthe Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner\\nfree.\\n\\nThen the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms\\nand told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent.\\n\\n\"But why didn\\'t you tell us at first?\"\\n\\nshe

the folks of Oz\\nknew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accident\\nhad prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tiger\\npreferred not to associate with her.\\n\\nEureka was forbidden to wander\\naround the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy\\'s room;\\nso she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place where\\nshe could enjoy herself better.\\n\\nDorothy was herself anxious to get home, so she promised Eureka they\\nwould not stay in the Land of Oz much longer.\\n\\nThe next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allow\\nher to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readily\\nconsented.\\n\\nShe took the child to her room and said: \"Make your wish,\\ndear, and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold.\"\\n\\nThen Dorothy found, with the aid of the enchanted picture, that Uncle\\nHenry had returned to the farm in Kansas, and she also saw that both he\\nand Aunt Em were dressed in mourning, because they thought their little\\nniece had been killed by the earthquake.\\n\\n\"Really,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"I must get back as soon as poss\\'ble\\nto my own folks.\"\\n\\nZeb also wanted to see his home, and although he did not find anyone\\nmourning for him, the sight of Hugson\\'s Ranch in the picture made him\\nlong to get back there.\\n\\n\"This is a

stone overtook him and struck his\\nboney body.\\n\\nThey did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything\\nwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the\\nhorse and

thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over\\nthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.\\n\\nFar below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.\\n\\nThe central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.\\n\\nAround it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five\\nbrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one\\nblue and one orange.\\n\\nThis splendid group of colored suns sent rays\\ndarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy and\\nZeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays\\nbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more\\nand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly\\nilluminated.\\n\\nDorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim\\'s big ears\\nturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should\\nbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of\\na zebra.\\n\\nThen she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was\\npink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it funny?\"\\n\\nshe said.\\n\\nThe boy was startled and his eyes were big.\\n\\nDorothy had a green streak\\nthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came\\ntogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.\\n\\n\"I--I don\\'t s-s-see any-thing funny--\\'bout it!\"\\n\\nhe stammered.\\n\\n[Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL

was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had\\npassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing\\nrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep\\nsigh.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t keep falling forever, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"We are

that\\nthey reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were\\ncarefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened\\nwith a bow of colored ribbon.\\n\\n\"Where did you come from?\"\\n\\nasked Dorothy, wonderingly.\\n\\n\"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not\\nrecently.\\n\\nOnce I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had\\nmy

So what\\ncould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"?

FRANK BAUM\\n\\n  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\\n\\n\\n         *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n  [Illustration]\\n\\n\\n  DEDICATED TO HARRIET A. B. NEAL.\\n\\n\\n         *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTo My Readers\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s no use; no use at all. The children won\\'t let me stop telling tales\\nof the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell\\nthem, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won\\'t allow\\nme. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but\\nobey their commands?\\n\\nThis is Our Book--mine and the children\\'s. For they have flooded me with\\nthousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to\\nadopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.\\n\\nAfter the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy\\nhas become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all love\\nDorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn\\'t a real\\nOz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and\\ninnocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.\\n\\nThere were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about\\nthe Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the\\nfirst Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\\n\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a\\nballoon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So what\\ncould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You will\\nfind him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.'"

      "Component One: Planning#\n",
      "A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\n",
      "Task Decomposition#\n",
      "Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n",
      "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n",
      "Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\n",
      "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\n",
      "Self-Reflection#\n",
      "Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\n",
      "ReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\n",
      "The ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\n",

      "In both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\n",
      "Reflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n",

      "Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\n",
      "The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\n",
      "Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n",

      "Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\n",
      "To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\n",
      "The training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\n",
      "The idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\n",
      "The paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\n",
      "In reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\n",
      "In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\n",

      "Types of Memory#\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\n",
      "Implicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\n",
      "We can roughly consider the following mappings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\n",
      "Short-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\n",
      "Long-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\n",
      "The external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\n",
      "A couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\n",
      "\n",
      "LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\n",
      "ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\n",
      "HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\n",
      "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\n",
      "ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n",

      "MRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\n",
      "They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\n",
      "Both TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\n",

The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order.

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more.

      "\n",
      "Finite context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\n",

      "\n",
      "Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\n",

      "Task decomposition refers to a process where complex tasks are broken down into smaller, more manageable steps. This is achieved by instructing the model to \"think step by step\" using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting technique, which enhances its performance on complex tasks. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and sheds light into an interpretation of the model's thinking process.\n"
